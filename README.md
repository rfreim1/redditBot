redditBot
=========


Following a project I found on reddit to just do some fun and extensible. Will start using regex then work my way up to using reddit API and maybe making a bot that actually posts.

Project Overview(from reddit \u\Feroc and changed slightly):
Code the reddit-image-downloader (or the reddit-aww-downloader, if you want to have it SFW).
It should do something like this:
Scan the first page of /r/aww
Read all the names of the users
Download all pictures that those users ever posted in a separate folder.
Don't overwrite and add new pictures to existing folder
